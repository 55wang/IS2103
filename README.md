An example app for j2ee glassfish

This is my school assignment for IS2103. It is a simulation for hotel booking service.

It is also hosted on http://testyourcode-i.comp.nus.edu.sg:8080/StarHotelSystem-war/

However, you have to be in nus school network in order to access this page.

I would be glad that if my project can help you in any way, feel free to contact me via facebook.com/wangzhe.lynx or wangzhe.lynx@gmail.com
